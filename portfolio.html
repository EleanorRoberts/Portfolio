		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<div class="#">
			Hi, I'm Ellie and I like coding, my dog Nova and gaming. I'm currently completing iO Academy's Full Stack Track programming bootcamp (and loving it!).<br> In my free time, I enjoy learning Japanese, walking my dog, playing piano, spending far too much time on Zelda and finding new hobbies.
